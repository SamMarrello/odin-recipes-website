    <p>Chili is a simple American dish that can be made even simpler by using a slow cooker. Put it in before work and it's ready after dinner!</p>
    <h2>The ingredients you'll need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large Spanish Onion</li>
        <li>1/3rd of a pound of ground beef</li>
        <li>1/3rd of a pound of ground pork</li>
        <li>8 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>Secret Spice Blend</li>
        <li>2 28 oz cans red kidney beans</li>
        <li>1 small can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 28oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Small amount of red wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, pour a tablespoon of oil into a frying pan and heat until shimmering</li>
        <li>While waiting, finely chop your onion</li>
        <li>Add onion to frying pan. Slowly fry under medium heat for around 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Then add the ground beef and pork, stirring together</li>
        <li>After all the ground meat is browned, add your spice mixture. Mine's a secret, but you can find great ones online!</li>
        <li>After only about 30 seconds to ensure the spices don't burn and turn bitter, take the pan off the stove and put the mixture in a greased slow cooker</li>
        <li>Deglaze the frying pan to ensure all juices and coat from the frying go into the slow cooker. I use wine for more flavour, but you can use water, stock, or any other liquid</li>
        <li>Dump all other ingredients into the slow cooker. Stir together well</li>
        <li>Put on high for 4 hours, or low for 8 hours. The longer, the better</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Congratulations! You've easily made a weeks long dinner!</p>
